                    Three days in Çıralı, Turkey, at a beautiful eco-bungalow hotel by the sea, offering space for dance, improvisation, and creative exploration. Pedro Penuella, a psychotherapist, shares his knowledge of contact improvisation through a somatic approach, drawing on his therapeutic experience, while Tamara Maksimenko leads poetic, inspired movement practices exploring love and rejection, acceptance and denial, in solo and paired work. 
                    <br><br>
                    The seaside atmosphere and the surrounding mountains naturally encourage shared time together, from gentle walks and local excursions to evening jams, offering three days to move, breathe, connect, and simply be. Open to all genders, 18+, in a supportive and open environment.</p>

                      My name is Pedro Penuela. I've been practicing and researching Contact Improvisation for twenty years, having had the opportunity to study with many teachers worldwide and to directly interview Steve Paxton, the choreographer who leaded its creation in the seventies, at his house in Vermont, USA.
                      I am also a psychotherapist, with a master degree in clinical psychology by the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil), working privately with patients for more than ten years.
                      <br><br>
                      In my classes for "Coastal Reverie", we'll focus on some elements and principles of Contact Improvisation that can provide very meaningful opportunities to know more about ourselves and our patterns of relationship and communication with others. In this sense, we'll be deepening our awareness of important aspects of the practice and of ourselves.
                      <br><br>
                      The first class will focus on the diversity of tissues and layers in the body, and the different qualities and flavours of movement when we are tunned to these different tissues. Moreover, we'll also work with perceveing and increasing awareness of layers and intentions of touch, in order to deepen our ability to listen and to enrich our communication with our partners.
                      <br><br>
                      The second class will focus on different aspects of the experience and the sense of support. To do that, we'll work with the perception of weight and gravity, then we'll have a journey starting from a place of being totally supported and guided by another person, through the process of finding and being aware of our own ways to fully support ourselves, noticing the different stages and possibilities that exist between these two points.

                        Hi there,<br><br>

                        I’m Tamara Maksymenko — a nomadic soul, dancer, choreographer, performer, and teacher of Contemporary Dance and Contact Improvisation for almost two decades.
                        <br><br>
                        My journey weaves through many lands and stories:<br>
                        I studied body therapy at Dnipro Medical University and physical theatre in Switzerland, danced for MTV shows, and lived and created in Lebanon, Italy, and now Austria, my current home.
                        <br><br>
                        My art is born from movement, emotion, and memory — from moments both stunning and tragic.<br>
                        I dance this life — and I invite you to dance it with me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At the Coastal Reviere, I will guide two classes where we explore the dialogue between body and emotion, self and other — through solo and contact improvisation.<br>
                        We’ll play with opposites: contraction and expansion, embrace and resistance, love and conflict.
                        <br><br>
                        Expect poetic moments, physical intensity, and space for imagination.<br>
                        You’ll discover how your own inner images can move your body in new and unexpected ways.
                        <br><br>
                        No previous experience is needed — just curiosity, presence, and breath.<br>
                        Everyone is welcome on this journey.
                    </p>
