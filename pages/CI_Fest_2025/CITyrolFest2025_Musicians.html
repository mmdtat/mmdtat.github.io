                        Mirjam has been dancing Contact Improvisation for seven years, driven by her excitement for movement, connection, and an ongoing curiosity to explore life through the body.
                        <br><br>
                        She lives in Austria, teaches Yoga, and has a deep interest in somatic practices and nervous system regulation. Alongside her work in a non-dance-related field, she enjoys creating spaces where people can move, connect, and not take themselves too seriously.

                        She is happy to be part of the organising team at the Solo & CI Festival and looks forward to sharing this experience with everyone, on and off the dance floor.
