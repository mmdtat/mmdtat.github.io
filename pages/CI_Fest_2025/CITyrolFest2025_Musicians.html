                        <p>
                            Dancing, singing and listening to music were part of my life from a young age. Honestly, it feels like my true musical journey has just begun. I took singing lessons for a few years, and earlier this year, I discovered the handpan—a deeply expressive instrument that instantly resonated with me. It gives me the rhythm and grounding I need to let my emotions flow freely, even without formal musical training. Through its sound, I’ve found a way to express myself and connect on a more intuitive, heartfelt level. I'm looking forward sharing this with you!

                            "How can we
                        …exist in community & be ourselves at the same time?<br>
                        …move freely respecting each other's boundaries?<br>
                        …embody emotions & dance to flow?"<br><br>



                        Nepomuk likes to generate questions. Since his childhood, he has felt the urge to express his spirit.<br>
                        He has been deeply inspired by teachers like Xandy Liberato, Félix Arjona & Tamara, too.<br>
                        It is now that he allows himself to follow his inner calling. In contact improvisation he has found a place where his creativity has free rain.<br><br>

                        He studied psychology & educational studies. Nepo is a sharing circle holder & care worker for children. He has the quality to create an atmosphere in which a person can be oneself.<br><br>

                        As a musician of the festival he wants to manifest his visions & inspire other human beings.

                            Performance art is more than a display of rehearsed movements and melodies.<br>
                            Improvised music breaks down the barrier between listener and performer—one often created by predetermined plans and structured execution.

                            “Everything I play begins with a fundamental idea, like the seed of a poem, and evolves in real time. When I start to play, the audience and I begin with the same information. As the music unfolds, we journey together into uncharted territory. ”

                            Dance - I am here and now. I feel a bit more alive in space and time - as if the door to heaven were slightly open. I am creator, filled with joy and depth. 
                            <br><br>
                            Improvisation brings me back to a primal human state, constantly searching for its own rules and patterns.  
                            I'm asking, "What are we playing here, and what's the common thread?" 
                            <br><br>
                            I trained at the following schools: <br>
                            • <b>Freiburg TIP</b> (School for Dance, Improvisation, and Performance):       3 months <br>
                            • <b>Tanzfabrik Berlin</b> (Dance Intensive, specializing in Contemporary Dance): 1 year <br>
                            • <b>Kassel SoZo-Vim</b> (School for Contemporary Stage Dance):               3 years <br><br>

                            Every physical activity and training session f lows into and enriches my dance. <br><br>
                            However, nothing captivates me as much as <b>Contact Improvisation</b>. It is where all facets of my movement practice and research come together - right now.

Currently she offers Feet Up Head Down - a capoeira roots into C.I. one-day workshop, Morning Glory - a weekly 8am dance party in Mödling, Austria and IOM Somatisches Tanztraining courses.
