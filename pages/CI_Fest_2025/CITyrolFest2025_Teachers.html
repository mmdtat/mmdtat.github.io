                This year, we're thrilled to announce that the headliner of our 7th festival will be the legendary Daniel Lepkoff, one of the pioneers of Contact Improvisation! To honor this special opportunity, we've extended the festival to a full 8 days of immersive CI dancing and exploration.
                <br><br>
                You will find all teachers who will share their experience during the festival on this page. <br><br>

                            DANIEL LEPKOFF is a dancer known for bringing the process of living movement into the studio and onto the stage. <br><br>
                            Since the early '70's he played a central role in the development of Release Technique with Mary Fulkerson and Contact Improvisation with Steve Paxton. Throughout the '70's and '80's he traveled extensively; teaching, performing and exposing these new ideas worldwide.<br><br>
                            He was one of the founders of Movement Research in NYC (1975), playing as active role in defining the initial conception of this seminal organization: designing new programs, curating events, teaching regular classes and offering intensive workshops.<br><br>
                            Living in New York City in the '80's Daniel performed in the works of several choreographers including: Trisha Brown, Simone Forti, Mary Fulkerson, Lisa Nelson, Mary Overlie, Judy Padow, Steve Paxton, & Nancy Topf. In this period his own movement based solo and group work experimented with the elements of voice, text, film, video, & photography, and interactions with physical objects. His work has been shown at Danspace, PS122, Movement Researh at Jusdon Church, in New York City as well as internationally throughout Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, and South America.<br><br>
                            Over the years Daniel has engaged in several long term and important collaborations with other performing artists including: Lisa Nelson, Steve Paxton; Paul Langland, Saira Blanche Theater in Moscow (Oleg Soulimenko and Andrej Andrianov), Hungarian experimental musician Dora Attila and Japanese dancer, Sakura Shimada, among others.
                            In 2002, working with Mira Kovarva and The Bratislava in Movement Festival Daniel was the artistic director of ' Rozhovory tiel / Physical Dialogues' a seminal artistic/educational event that brought a cross section of mature and developed approaches to improvisation.<br><br>
                            He has published numerous articles articulating concepts that are central to his approach to dance making. These writings appear in Contact Quarterly, The MR Performance Journal, and Contredanse Publications in Bruxelles, and on his website: <a href="https://daniellepkoff.com/index.php">www.daniellepkoff.com</a><br><br>
                            He lives on a piece of land in Vermont.

                            "MARKER: BODYGRAPHY ON THE FLOOR WALL"
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            How can bodies and surfaces be marked by intentional or unintentional actions?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How do ensembles change composition? And how do solos flourish during these markings?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through the practice of marking, we will analyse and experience from a scientific as well as an artistic point of view (combining different techniques) the concept of marking in solo dance and in the practice of Ensemble Contact Improvisation. Thanks to these marks, we will translate into space an exploration that is guided at first and spontaneous at a later stage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The focus will be on the awareness of how these mnemonic and material scars influence the environment of practice and the relationships created in it.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The process will be marked in a dialogue between pauses and translation on paper and movement. <br>
                            The dance will be both ensemble and solo in order to observe the difference of moving from a complex organ such as being in a group and collectivity to returning to oneself with the wake of the marks left by others.<br><br>

                            It is not necessary to be a visual artist, this is a device for dancers (especially in the dynamics of Contact Improvisation) to make the intuitive choice that the body feels resurface.<br>
                            We will work with simplicity and synthesis, taking away rather than adding and without acting automatically and compulsively in flying or falling.
                            <br><br>
                            We will also have the pleasure of crossing the perspective of our map directly on the wall, after travelling from the floor.

                        <p>
                            In these two classes we will work on skills, techniques and forms that help us to access a sense and experience of support. This aims to bring safety in motion and to open a wide range of movement possibilities that can be investigated and explored during an improvisation, especially in situations of weight exchange.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To develop it, we'll focus on:<br><br>

                            . Sensing, knowing and experimenting with and from our skeleton,<br>
                            . Dynamic alignments and embodied understanding of our supports and ways to offer support,<br>
                            . Tuning to the reflex intelligence in our own body and in the others',<br>
                            . Feeling and playing with gravity and action-reaction interplay with the ground,<br>
                            . Pathways to connect the whole body and to feel its different architectures in each moment,<br>
                            . Forms that teach the body important skills when "flying", <br>
                            . Feeling and getting awareness of the center of gravity and it's role in CI,<br>
                            . Use of momentum, leverages and centripetal forces.

                            Lecture with Pedro: "The political relevance of some principles of Contact Improvisation" 
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The lecture will discuss ethical and political implications that characterize Contact Improvisation, highlighting the relevance of some of its principles, such as: <br>
                            1. The dilation of time and the stretching of perception, <br>
                            2. The question of resistance (or the resistance under question), <br>
                            3. The rupture with the imperative of productivity, <br>
                            4. The (open) question of community, collective bonds and spaces of "refuge".<br>
                            By examining these aspects, we highlight how this dance form subverts the hegemonic cultural imperatives of accelerating action, densifying stimulation and increasing productivity, as well as it helps us to problematize the notion of resistance and the strategies of political and cultural opposition to a status quo, thus having the potential to create particular spaces of sharing, articulated by commonalities in perception and sensitivity.
