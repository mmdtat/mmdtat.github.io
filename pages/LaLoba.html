			<p class="citat"><i>History...<br>
			La Loba project is based on the previous successfully done "FEMINILE" in 2015 when Motion Mode Dance Theatre was born. <br>
			With the time, traveling and looking around in a seek of what is going on in the whole World between men and women, this project has transformed with another title and essence of what to light for society. <br>
			The idea of reconstruction FEMMINILE project into La Loba performance was born after reading a book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_Who_Run_with_the_Wolves">Clarissa Pinkola Estés “Running with Wolves”</a>. This book is about female archetypes, which are narrated with the help of legends and fairy tales from different cultures: from the French tale "Bluebeard" - to the most important female archetype of Mexico - La Loba. <br></i></p>
			<br><img src="../gallery/2019_03_15_LaLoba-90.jpg" class="ph2">
			<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Who is LaLoba? </b><br>
			La Loba is living in deserts and mountains. She is a wolf woman, a collector of bones, who resurrects the wild spirit of life from the depths of the Underworld. <br>
			There is an old woman who lives in a hidden place that everyone knows but a few only have ever seen. As in the fairy tales of Eastern Europe, she seems to wait for lost or wandering people and seekers to come to her place. <br>
			The archetype of La Loba units in itself the true nature of a woman like a she-wolf, and also the tale of La Loba is a narration of several stories where a man is a very important figure. The job of her is to collect stories - bones. To live as alive as she can, to go through ups&downs.</p>
