	   Mechanical Engineer, since 1997 is dedicated to Street Art, juggling and equilibrium, from 2002 it became his main job. In 2003 he came in contact with the Biotransazionale Method and begins to practise it and study its principles, and to integrate them with the study of circus techniques; simultaneously he got formed artistically by attending various courses of Equilibrium (Arial Miluca, Claude Victoria), clown (Rita Pelusio, Jean Manigault, Michelin Vanderpoel), dance (Claude Coldy, Lucia Latour, Ketty Russo, Simona Fichera, Marta Ciappina, Tom Weksler, Kira Kirsh, Nita Little, Angelika Donji, Ray Chung), studying theater at "Pontedera Theatre Foundation" (2004-2005) and working at the Bellucci Aquatic Circus  (2005-2006).

		<b><span style="font-size: 30px;">The main course </span><br> <span style="font-size: 25px;">Fly with Flow between sky and floor</span></b><img src="../gallery/teachers1.jpg" class="ph2" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; "> <br> <br> 

		The main focus of this intensive workshop is to learn how to train our body to improve its health conditions and at the same time its movement skills for individual dance and contact improvisation. Every day it will be composed of three different and integrated parts: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				We will start with an Active Postural Stretching in Movement, based on the knowledge of how the parts of the body are connected and using it to reduce compensation and get the stretching more efficient. Through this training, we will meet our body's particular limits, and learn to not pass them, and increase them in a respectful way while getting awareness of the connections between the different parts. In this way, we will enhance our movement possibilities and get already the movement more 
			</li>
			<li>
				We will then explore the individual movement and how to get it efficient, fluid and effortless. We will learn some important basic tools (floorwork, change of levels, back bending, reversing the weight on the hands) that will get the personal movement's research more safe and rich and joyful. 
			</li>
			<li>
				We will finally learn how to improvise in contact with other bodies, looking for flow and enjoyment. This last part integrates the tools explored in the first part of the class with the intent of learning how to listen to the partner's movement and communicate in an easy and effortless way, up to support and be supported and fly with easiness and care.
			</li>
		</ul>
 		<br>

		<p>The training proposed is a healing process for several reasons:	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Active Postural Stretching is derived by a physiotherapeutic approach (named Biotransazionale) and causes a better alignment of the body; </li>
			<li>Exploring one's personal movement with this gentle approach helps the body to redistribute the tensions in a coherent way; </li>
			<li>The training helps to open one's vision and be more adaptable to the external conditions;</li>
			<li>It also develops trust and listening for oneself and for the partner, without schemes or predetermined roles, invites the authenticity in communication and then in relationships</li>
		</ul>

	</p> <br> <br>
	<p><b><span style="font-size: 30px;">ISE technique class Images / Sensation / Expression.</span></b><br>  <br>

		It is a non-stop session for 1h. You follow the instructions of the teacher, which are layered sequences. <br>

		We delicately awake the deep sensors of the body; practicing balance, strength, flexibility. We connect to our inner source of power, space and other people in motion. <br>
		We work without mirrors and allow different images to appear in motion. Therefore, a clear understanding of form comes not from copying, but from deep palette of bodily sensations.<img src="../gallery/nueva 1.jpg" class="ph2" style="width: 25%; height: 25%; float: left; margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px;"> <a name="Location"></a><br>
		We become to be aware of our patterns in posture and movements. We are searching for new ways of self-presentation. <br>

		This class is about joy, fun, jokes, health, creativity, sensations and clarity in movement, dance and daily life. It combines 5 modern dance techniques, sense of humor and the holistic art of osteopathy. <br>

		Get enough sleep before the class. <br>
		Wear comfortable, soft clothes, not a skirt. No shoes needed, socks or barefoot. Order a sunny day and come 5 min in advance
