                                <b>CLASS DESCRIPTION <br>"Dancing as Political Healing"</b><br>

                                Prioritizing improvisation and collaboration we will play with the possibilities of healing, politics, and dancing together. This laboratory will welcome your curiosity and concerns. What’s up? What inspires you or prevents you from dancing more freely? What activates or impedes your healing potential? How is your body responding to new wars and embodied traumas? How can dancing and care be activated as anti-capitalism, as a new ethics of relationship, pleasure, and shared power? We will invite the prophetic ancestors Gustav Landauer and Octavia Butler into the studio to renew our dancing.

                            <b>CLASS DESCRIPTION <br>"Dancing in sensitivity" </b><br>
                            <i>I believe that when we dance, we dance with all the stories we carry inside our bodies. <br>
                            We dance with information and with memories. <br>
                            But I also believe that while we dance, we can make new memories and leave new imprints inside our bodies.  </i><br>
                            I love to work with attention and intention. Receptivity and sensations. 
                            This helps to create quality of movement and also allows different ways of meeting each other and cocreating the dance. To enter the flow requires to sense the currents that are already there… inside the body, inside the space… in between us.

                            Born in Barcelona. Since young I've practiced a great variety of sports and different kinds of disciplines such as martial arts, acrobatics, parkour, dance and gymnastics. At the age of 18 I started my acting studies with the idea of getting to know myself and transmitting better to others. That was the beginning of 6 years of studying and working in BCN and NY. It was also when I discovered CI, which was taught as a tool for physical listening within physical theater. Some events made me question and redirect my path towards traveling and focusing more on movement, contact and facilitation. I´ve been traveling, dancing, and facilitating workshops on CI and conscious movement since then.

                            We start by landing through relaxing our bodies and surrendering our weight to the ground. We will start moving slowly focusing on the weight of different parts of our body, specially the head.<br>
                            Coming to partners, we will offer some bodywork on head and neck and will start sustaining it as the partner moves through the space, enjoying being sustained. We will change roles, and merge them into dance.<br>
                            We make a circle of sustenance as one person moves within blindfolded changing direction with the touch from people in the circle.<br>
                            Keeping the circle, we will have one person in the middle falling to sides and being sustained, and maybe even offering them the possibility of being elevated.<br>
                            After some variants working on trust, presence and listening, we will go through a technique exercise focusing on the slowness and care of the partner.<br>
                            We will finish with a trio exercise (algui and currents), having a trip where two people will be sustaining and moving the third one (who will be blindfolded) through the space.

                                As a musician I accompany dancers during their improvisation classes and contact
                                jams with guitar, voice, steel tongue drum, cajón and diverse soundscapes which
                                create a mixture between classical, ambient and minimal music. Additionally I teach
                                guitar workshops for beginners at the Volkshochschule Tirol.
