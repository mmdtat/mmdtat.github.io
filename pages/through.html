					<p><b>Methodology:</b> <br>
We will all work together closely on physical theatre tools, contemporary dance improvisation, contact improvisation daily (detailed schedule is below). We will learn how and when to use voice during theatrical improvisation; where are the strongest spots on the stage; we will learn some dance patterns which will be useful during performance. <br><br>
<b>Techniques:</b> <br>
BMC (Body mind Centering), flying low, contact improvisation, axis syllabus, mime (working with objects) and poetry. <br><br>
<b>Creation:</b> <br>
We will reveal the philosophy of the project as we rehearse the piece: We will look at the life’s obstacles and how we humans struggle THROUGH them. What is the impact of our choice? Uncovering lies and truth is a big part of this workshop. Humans blurr and smash their own truth, playing the game of “who am I?” every single day. In the project “THROUGH”, we will discuss and dance about things that touch and bother us. Be ready to bring your drama and humour together onto the stage and if you have something to share with the public - go on! <br><br>
The essence of what the group discovers during the workshop will produce a performance based on improvisation.
</p> <br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">If you have never tried performing - it’s
your chance. We are open to the
possibility of bringing people together with
different dance experiences. If you are a
professional artist or a beginner - our
doors are open to you.
</p> <br>
<p>A method of creation is improvisation - every
participant will have the opportunity to express
their thoughts and feelings. We are here to
support and guide you.
