Angie started dancing with the age of 3 years and gained experience in Ballet, Jazz (Lyrical, Funky), Modern Dance (Limon, Horton) Contemporary (Release Technique, Gaga, Floowork Techniques, Counter Technique), Improvisation, Contact Improvisation, Somatic Practices (Feldenkrais) and Body Work (Gyrokinesis).
She graduated at the Anton Bruckner University and has a bachelor degree in stage dance and dance pedagogy. After working as a dancer at Norrdans in Sweden she decided to come back to start a master study program in Linz and is still in that process. During her bachelor studies her interest for body work increased to find an organic way of moving, reduce the risk of injury and using the function and structure of the body in a natural way. Especially Gyrokinesis, Contact Improvisation and Feldenkrais helped her to move with less muscle tension, to take care of the body, using the body as a whole through an increased body awareness (through proprioceptive training). Due to her interest for somatic practices she decided to certify in the GyrokinesisⓇ method and furthermore took Feldenkrais privat classes to deepen her knowledge about a deepenly-developed sensitivity and body awareness.
From the artistic perspective she was performing for example in the Landestheater in Linz, Brucknerhaus, Tour in Sweden (Umea, Sundsvall), Italy, Germany, Landesgalerie in Linz. At the moment she is creating and touring with a group of four dancers and is based in Munich and tries to connect pedagogical and artistic wise there.

	Do you sense that you sense what you sense?
<br><br>
At the moment I am interested in the biggest and first-developed sensory organ which represents the skin and its abilties which are getting more and more atrophied and unconscious. Nowadays touching yourself or other bodies and receiving consciously information from our sensation gets more and more uncommon and the result is an atrophied tactile sense. Different researches has shown that we can trust and use our kinesic empathy for each other and furthermore trust our body and its intelligence and knowledge.
In this outdoor warm up you will activate your senses, especially the skin through touching different objects, yourself and other bodies. The proprioception will be activated through oiling the joints and relating different body parts with each other.  Furthermore the body parts will have an interplay with each other, with other bodies and the nature.

	How do you move on me? <br>
Me being your floor, your support. Maybe not forever, not the whole of the time.<br>
Maybe we can change?
<br><br>
How do I move on you? <br>
You being my earth, my support, but not my safety. Not forever.<br>
We can exchange.
<br><br>
How do we move on each others? <br>
Building bridges and structures,  sometimes letting them fall, sometimes let them burn to light our way.
<br><br>
To truly work is to enjoy, because to truly work, there is passion in it, and passion, is to enjoy, even when it’s not fun.
<br><br>
How do we work together? Supporting each others, arguing at times, going against and going with, moving.
<br><br>
It’s about organisation. How do I need to organise myself to move on you. How do I organise myself for you to move on me. <br>
How do we organise ourselves together, to make (more) things possible?
<br><br>
Contact improvisation: <br>
We look at the specific technique of moving and guiding the forces of weight and support. How our perception guides the choices we make? How do we organize ourselves in the perpetual change? Working together and working gently againts, we look for new possibilities of pattern, and how to collect and raise physical energy.
