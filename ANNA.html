                <p class="plain_text">    
                    This project has its roots in the challenging times of COVID in 2021, when it was initially conceived with a different theme and idea. Over the years, the concept has evolved and matured, allowing the creator to find clear and precise words to fully express the vision behind it. It has been a journey of refinement, boiling down to a clear and powerful message.

                    Feminine idea
                </h3>
                <p class="plain_text">    
                    The performer - Tamara Maksymenko is rooted in Ukraine. Within the post soviet childhood, studying in Swiss, working in Lebanon and Morrocco and finally settled in Austria she explored the female aspect from different continents and historical events during her life path.
                     <br><br>
                    There are notable differences between post-Soviet and Western feminism, shaped by historical, cultural, political, and socio-economic factors, even though they share a common goal of achieving gender equality or justice between two genders. Western feminism, with its roots in democratic processes and civil rights movements, emphasizes individual autonomy, workplace equality, and intersectionality. In contrast, post-Soviet feminism, emerging from a collectivist and tumultuous post-communist landscape, focuses on reconceptualizing gender roles, addressing economic challenges, and overcoming cultural resistance. Post-Soviet societies often have more traditional views on gender roles, with a strong emphasis on motherhood and family.
                    Understanding these differences is crucial for appreciating the diverse manifestations of feminism and the unique challenges faced by women in different regions.
