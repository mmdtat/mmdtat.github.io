                <h1>Place</h1>
                <p class="plain_text">
                    Few words about the place. We have found an amazing campsite in the mountains in one of the most popular climbing areas in the World - Geyikbayiri. There is cosy accommodation, as well as a 102 m2 dance room with a view of 360 degrees, and meals 2 times per day (Breakfast and Dinner). <br>
                    Antalya airport is the closest; which makes your travel to the campsite easy and enjoyable. From Antalya airport - you can take a taxi which will cost approximately 20 euros to the spot, or public transport which is approximately about 3 euros.
                    <br>
                    *The festival can help participants to organize transport from Airport to Geyikbayiri.

                    The festival team is concerned about the Worldwide situation. We know how important to have time for self-development and self-retreat. We offer high-quality content with very available prices.
                    <br><br>
This year we would have two main teachers and two different and helpful disciplines: solo improvisation and Contact Improvisation.
<br><br>
The team of the festival is highly concerned about the safety of participants (physical and mental), and we believe that the knowledge of solo dance is a foundation for confident contact improvisation dance. That's why we have combined solo dance morning sessions with the Contact Improvisation session in the afternoon.

                     In this workshop, we will explore the fluid and temporary equilibrium states that we move through in our dances. We will practice falling into different directions, rising up with the support of the ground, feeling both our own and our partners’ connection to the earth while we are off-balance.

                     Solo Improvisation Workshop: Senses, Movement, Space <br><br>
                     This workshop is about tuning into our senses and recognizing how our sensations effect our movement and our connection with the space. We will specificly work with three of our senses: sight, touch and sound. We will practice tracing the sensations individually and in combinations as well as tuning out our senses. This practice will help us with transitioning between different ways of attending to our senses while moving.

                    Having received five years of Capoeira training from Brazilian Mestre Kiura, Emin develops techniques for movement improvisations, synthesizing contemporary and “non-contemporary” dance performances, workshops, films, sound-based works, installations, situations and research projects. He shares and publishes his artistic works and research projects under the umbrella of his newly found company: Sphinx Dance.
                    <br> <br>
                    Emin has collaborated with different contemporary dance artists such as Moa Westerlund, Sebastian Lingserius, Peter Mills and Cristina Caprioli. His works were shown in different venues such as Dansenshus, Moderna Dans Teatern, R1 Nuclear Reactor, Weld and CCAP in Stockholm, Skogen in Gothenburg, Borderland in Denmark, and Refugio in Berlin. <br>

                    Emin's somatic works range eclectically between different styles, mostly being based on different contemporary concepts he's intrigued about. Most recently he has developed an ongoing performance project called "Antibodies"; which relates to the impulsivity of body, norms of resistance, stimuli, trigger, immune, quarrel etc. Emin will share a workshop within this concept, as well as Spiral Sphinx; his most practiced movement framework that he developed and practiced throughout years inspired mainly from Capoeira and Butoh among other things...

                     I was never satisfied with the work associated only with musical instruments, I became interested in exploring the instruments that a person is gifted with.  That is, I began to explore such an important tool as our voice, attention, hearing, and every time I discover more and more new possibilities and facets of the wonderful magical human ability to sound.  How our sound is related to physicality, how important hearing is.<br>
                     I explore improvisational singing, free sounding, spiritual chants, traditional folk
