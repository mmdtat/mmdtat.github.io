                    We are thrilled to announce our fifth annual "Solo & CI Tirol Festival" which will traditionally take place in Austria. We believe that our mission is to maintain and strengthen the physical and mental health of our community that becomes vital as never before. <br>
                    The "Solo & CI Festival" is a safe space for you, your friends and your family, where you will have a chance to get acquainted with contact improvisation, contemporary dance and take part in daily jams. Being surrounded with spectacular Tyrolean landscapes, its impressive mountain ridges, virgin forests, and pure untouchable nature you will get a perfect chance to recharge your batteries and find new meanings and directions.<br>
                    We share one great passion: contact improvisation. However, in recent years, we feel that contact improvisation has stalled in its development. We want to keep the original purpose of contact improvisation, which is an EXPLORATION. Therefore, this year we offer a wide range of different disciplines to enrich your dance and also look at contact improvisation from a new angle.
                </p>

                  <p class="plain_text">
                      An educator and dancer. He graduated CUUD Breath Integration School. During his studies in Poznań, he worked in a forest kindergarten, and led CI classes and movement workshops for parents and children. <br>
                      He organizes jams, and workshops, and lead classes in various cities in Poland and festivals (Warsaw Flow, FRU festival, Israel CI Convention)
                      Paweł draws inspiration from practicing the Feldenkrais Method and AcroYoga. He enjoys learning new things, doing less (sometimes too much), and following curiosity and playfulness. <br>
                      He explores improvisation in motion and playing music - he is fascinated by combining these worlds and the dialogue between them.

                  <h3>Class description - moved to move</h3><p> (2 classes - 6 hours)</p>
                  <p class="plain_text"><br>
                      During the process of learning to dance Contact Improvisation, each of us acquires the language that we use on the jams. Sometimes we can unknowingly and habitually repeat certain sentences or consciously use only known words. As an example, we can have jam dancing only in duet and not exploring other possibilities.
                      In this class we will notice language we use and try learn new words, which will make our conversation more interesting.<br>
                      We start slowly by rolling our head on the floor. Maybe there are many words we have not heard before? Then we take that gentle quality into quite small talk and crazy conversation - trying to still listen carefully.<br>
                      Jam is the best teacher. We will talk to him using new words, being playful and open to the unknown<br><br>

                      Music: 
                      “I am fascinated by exploring the world of music combined with movement. When I play, I dance - because I play with my body. I am interested in exploring the world of didgeridoo and its production. Flute, jaw harp, glass, water, silence - I like to find sounds in instruments and less obvious things. I am interested in finding a dialogue between movement and music, discovering their similarities.”

                  <p class="plain_text">
                      Hands, hooks, touch.
                      During this workshop, we will look at some patterns where we use arms and hands mostly. The workshop will base on improvisation research and include clear forms of physical communication. How can we gently grab a partner giving him/her space to move? And what kind of dynamic between two people creates with hooks?
