                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Motion Mode of Dialogue was established by two women for whom gender equality is not just a principle, but a matter of life and survival. With a deep commitment to challenging societal norms, they believe in creating spaces where gender equality is actively addressed and supported, recognizing the urgency and impact it has on the lives of many individuals in the arts and beyond. <br><br>

                    The “Motion Mode of Dialogue in Tyrol” is committed to fostering an environment of equality, diversity, and inclusion. As an association for visual and performative art, we recognize the importance of gender balance in artistic expression and organizational management. This Gender Equality Plan (GEP) sets out clear goals, measures, and monitoring strategies to address gender disparities and ensure equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender.<br><br>
                </p>
