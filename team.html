		<b><span style="font-size: 25px;">The main course </span><br> <span style="font-size: 20px;">Fly with Flow between sky and floor</span></b><br> <br> 

		 The main focus of this intensive workshop is to learn how to train our body to improve its health conditions and at the same time its movement skills for individual dance and contact improvisation. Every day it will be composed of three different and integrated parts: <br><img src="../gallery/daniele 2.jpg" class="ph2" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; float: left; margin-top: 15px; padding: 0; margin-right: 30px;">
		<ul>
			<li>
				We will start with an Active Postural Stretching in Movement, based on the knowledge of how the parts of the body are connected and using it to reduce compensation and get the stretching more efficient. Through this training, we will meet our body's particular limits, and learn to not pass them, and increase them in a respectful way while getting awareness of the connections between the different parts. In this way, we will enhance our movement possibilities and get already the movement more 
			</li>
			<li>
				We will then explore the individual movement and how to get it efficient, fluid and effortless. We will learn some important basic tools (floorwork, change of levels, back bending, reversing the weight on the hands) that will get the personal movement's research more safe and rich and joyful. 
			</li>
			<li>
				We will finally learn how to improvise in contact with other bodies, looking for flow and enjoyment. This last part integrates the tools explored in the first part of the class with the intent of learning how to listen to the partner's movement and communicate in an easy and effortless way, up to support and be supported and fly with easiness and care.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The training proposed is a healing process for several reasons:	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Active Postural Stretching is derived by a physiotherapeutic approach (named Biotransazionale) and causes a better alignment of the body; </li>
			<li>Exploring one's personal movement with this gentle approach helps the body to redistribute the tensions in a coherent way; </li>
			<li>The training helps to open one's vision and be more adaptable to the external conditions;</li>
			<li>It also develops trust and listening for oneself and for the partner, without schemes or predetermined roles, invites the authenticity in communication and then in relationships</li>

		It is a non-stop session for 1h. You follow the instructions of the teacher, which are layered sequences. <br>

		
		We delicately awake the deep sensors of the body; practicing balance, strength, flexibility. We connect to our inner source of power, space and other people in motion.<img src="../gallery/nueva 1.jpg" class="ph2" style="width: 25%; height: 25%; float: left; margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0;padding-bottom: 0;"> <br>
		We work without mirrors and allow different images to appear in motion. Therefore, a clear understanding of form comes not from copying, but from deep palette of bodily sensations.<br>
		We become to be aware of our patterns in posture and movements. We are searching for new ways of self-presentation. <br>

		This class is about joy, fun, jokes, health, creativity, sensations and clarity in movement, dance and daily life. It combines 5 modern dance techniques, sense of humor and the holistic art of osteopathy. <br>

	<b><span style="font-size: 25px;">Workshop</span></p><br> <p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Imagination as a dance partner”</span></b></p><br>
	<p>	If neither current mood, playing music and my partner inspires my dance, can I find inspiration in Imagination? <br> 
   There are so many sources to dance. And imagination - is one of the greatest supporters for infinite movement energy. <br>
   Technically, an image influence the nervous system and through it in a certain way stimulate body muscles.  <img src="../gallery/kosko 2.jpg" class="ph2" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; float: left; margin-top: 15px; padding: 0; margin-right: 30px;">Our relation to image is emotion, that proposes movement direction and sets a certain intensity. <br>
  
   Moving from imagination, we can be completely free from external stimulation. <br> 
   In contact dance, sometimes I meet partner by the inner response, visually enchanted by his or her movements. And this image of echo moves me in common body language with my partner. <br>
   
   In 3 classes “Imagination as a dance partner” we explore different approaches in solo and contact dance from the point of creative imagination. <br>
	We’ll play with self-body Image and a new quality of it brings us to our new dance. With static postures, we will stimulate our imagination and create new movement patterns. We explore the magical connection between color and movement. We will seek for different ideas of movement image transformation. We will use movement and imagining skills to enrich our ability to enter and accommodate in a contact jam space. <br>
  All this process will lead to small groups performances, inspired and choreographed by our imagination score. <br>
