                                How can we free our body and allow it to simply respond to changes in space? How do changes in the body create a game in the interaction of the body with the external space and the partner's body? How not to lose yourself in the endless game of space and enjoy the meeting with the unknown? In our workshop, we will work with various systems of our body. We will try to synchronize these systems for the comfortable use of our body and the partner's body in interaction. We will try to take a different look at the basic principles of movement and interaction, and perhaps this will open up great opportunities for us and help create more freedom and interest in improvisation. Playing and experimenting with the physical abilities and states of our body.

                                During the process of learning to dance Contact Improvisation, each of us acquires the language that we use on the jams. Sometimes we can unknowingly and habitually repeat certain sentences or consciously use only known words. As an example, we can have jam dancing only in duet and not exploring other possibilities.
                                  In this class we will notice language we use and try learn new words, which will make our conversation more interesting.<br>
                                  We start slowly by rolling our head on the floor. Maybe there are many words we have not heard before? Then we take that gentle quality into quite small talk and crazy conversation - trying to still listen carefully.<br>
                                  Jam is the best teacher. We will talk to him using new words, being playful and open to the unknown<br><br>

                                  Music: 
                                  “I am fascinated by exploring the world of music combined with movement. When I play, I dance - because I play with my body. I am interested in exploring the world of didgeridoo and its production. Flute, jaw harp, glass, water, silence - I like to find sounds in instruments and less obvious things. I am interested in finding a dialogue between movement and music, discovering their similarities.”

                                What motivates my movement? <br>

                                  What motivates me while moving?<br><br>

                                  I work with attention on several levels according to the principle of cumulation: on the first physical (muscles) - work with body tone, balance, rotation, and development of dexterity. For movement, I offer simple tasks for work with speed, trajectory, displacement, repetitions, cyclicity, dynamics, amplitude, the direction of movement, and others. Then the second level is added attention to space: direct work with vision, fixing a view of the environment and oneself in it. Feeling in the present moment. The main focus is on haptic communication with space. At the third level, I pay attention to the sensation of my body, check how I touch the floor, where my body weight is, and where my attention is focused. I suggest giving time and space for the sensory system, to feel movement with skin, muscles, and bones. Feel the sounds and vibration, silence. To observe where a real movement is born, to follow it.<br><br>

                                  The last level will work with the composition, space, and time; with the object, with choreography.

                                This workshop is designed to address the questions and concerns that
                                arise when practicing Contact Improvisation, a social dance that involves
                                a lot of physical touch, often with strangers. The workshop will focus on
                                building self-confidence and establishing healthy boundaries in this type
                                of dance. Participants will learn what is allowed in Contact Improvisation
                                and how to communicate their boundaries effectively, both verbally and
                                non-verbally. The workshop will provide a safe and supportive
                                environment for participants to explore their own boundaries and
                                develop a clear understanding of what is comfortable for them. By the
                                end of the workshop, participants will feel more confident and
                                empowered in their ability to navigate the social and physical aspects of

                                Contact Improvisation.<br> <br> 
                                The workshop comprises of diverse exercises, games, and supportive
                                sharing circles. We will engage in physical activities such as touches and
                                bodywork, verbal practices, dance, and movement to work through the
                                body.

                                  Hands, hooks, touch.
                                  During this workshop, we will look at some patterns where we use arms and hands mostly. The workshop will base on improvisation research and include clear forms of physical communication. How can we gently grab a partner giving him/her space to move? And what kind of dynamic between two people creates with hooks?
