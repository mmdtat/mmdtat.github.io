                                How can we free our body and allow it to simply respond to changes in space? How do changes in the body create a game in the interaction of the body with the external space and the partner's body? How not to lose yourself in the endless game of space and enjoy the meeting with the unknown? In our workshop, we will work with various systems of our body. We will try to synchronize these systems for the comfortable use of our body and the partner's body in interaction. We will try to take a different look at the basic principles of movement and interaction, and perhaps this will open up great opportunities for us and help create more freedom and interest in improvisation. Playing and experimenting with the physical abilities and states of our body.

                                During the process of learning to dance Contact Improvisation, each of us acquires the language that we use on the jams. Sometimes we can unknowingly and habitually repeat certain sentences or consciously use only known words. As an example, we can have jam dancing only in duet and not exploring other possibilities.
                                  In this class we will notice language we use and try learn new words, which will make our conversation more interesting.<br>
                                  We start slowly by rolling our head on the floor. Maybe there are many words we have not heard before? Then we take that gentle quality into quite small talk and crazy conversation - trying to still listen carefully.<br>
                                  Jam is the best teacher. We will talk to him using new words, being playful and open to the unknown<br><br>

                                  Music: 
                                  “I am fascinated by exploring the world of music combined with movement. When I play, I dance - because I play with my body. I am interested in exploring the world of didgeridoo and its production. Flute, jaw harp, glass, water, silence - I like to find sounds in instruments and less obvious things. I am interested in finding a dialogue between movement and music, discovering their similarities.”

                                  What motivates me while moving?<br><br>

                                  I work with attention on several levels according to the principle of cumulation: on the first physical (muscles) - work with body tone, balance, rotation, and development of dexterity. For movement, I offer simple tasks for work with speed, trajectory, displacement, repetitions, cyclicity, dynamics, amplitude, the direction of movement, and others. Then the second level is added attention to space: direct work with vision, fixing a view of the environment and oneself in it. Feeling in the present moment. The main focus is on haptic communication with space. At the third level, I pay attention to the sensation of my body, check how I touch the floor, where my body weight is, and where my attention is focused. I suggest giving time and space for the sensory system, to feel movement with skin, muscles, and bones. Feel the sounds and vibration, silence. To observe where a real movement is born, to follow it.<br><br>

                                  The last level will work with the composition, space, and time; with the object, with choreography.

                                  Rebecca Plattner-Wörgartner was born in Kitzbühel (Austria) and is living happily with her lovely family in St. Johann in Tyrol (Austria). Becky started dancing at the age of 10 with Ballet and gradually got in touch with different dance styles and techniques such as Afro, HipHop, Jazz (Funky, Lyrical, Latin) Modern ( Horton, Limon, Graham) Musical and Contemporary Dance (floor release, counter technique) Improvisation (Instant Composition,Sasha Waltz, Kidd Pivot, Gaga).1993 she graduated in a pedagogical dance education in Munich at the Iwanson Dance Center and since that time she is teaching, dancing and choreographing at the „Tiroler Ballettschule“ and „Bad Reichenhaller Ballettschule“. Her wide ranged teaching, dancing and choreographing repertoire reaches from Ballet, Jazz, Contemporary, Improvisation. Becky is a passionate teacher and loves all her students which age extends from 3 to over 60 years.

                                  The first time when she experienced Contactimprovisation, which is nearly twenty years ago was with Willi Dorner (Bodies in Urban Spaces) and since this workshop she has not been able to let go of this kind of contemporary dance form and it caught continuously her attention and interest. To keep updated and get inspired she participated in several workshops such as by Scott Wells, Simonetta Alessandri, Frey Faust, Jörg Wenzel, Jose Biondi, Annette Lopez Leal and Malcom Manning. Since this remarkable moment in her life when she got to know Contact Improvisation she tried to establish a CI community in the east of Tyrol. Even though it was not so easy in the beginning as people were sceptical about it she didn’t let go and stayed persistent and due to her passion for CI which she transports clearly in her classes she build a small scene and has weekly her loyal followers.

                                "Consent Culture" is an environment built around mutual consent. It respects a personal decisions and autonomy of their own body and acknowledges that they are the best judge of their wants and needs. Consent is ongoing, meaning it can be withdrawn at any stage, and must be freely given. <br>
                                But we cannot experiment on mutual consent until we recognize consent in ourselves. We cannot explore our needs and desires apart from our body, since it is through it that we perceive the possibilities it offers us between restriction and freedom.<br>
                                If we take our body as a communication channel for our mind, which acts as a physical container that records experiences, this will be the best guide to understand consent as a continuous process of the person when making decisions and recognizing their autonomy.

                                Workshop Proposal
                                In this workshop we are going to explore as a group both the internal and external spaces
                                that help us to know where my own personal limits begin and end, and how these can change depending on the perception I have of oneself and of the other in a mutual
                                relationship.<br>
                                We are going to discover tools of body, sensory and emotional awareness that provide us
                                with the necessary knowledge to answer the questions that arise in personal interactions.<br>
                                We will create a climate of respect and mutual support to be able to deepen and allow
                                consent exploration proposals to be felt in a safe and reliable way.<br>
                                We will use materials that come from dance contact improvisation, gestalt therapy,
                                conscious contact and art therapy to reveal both visible and hidden contents that facilitate a
                                better relationship of consent with oneself and the rest of the group.

                            We present briefly the hystory of CI and open a talk about "What bothers us in Contact Improvisation World". We will open this space to talk about our fears, vulnerabilities, challenges - to be seen with them and to see others. We will talk about them and invite them to dance. We are going  to make the transition from hiding them to being acknowledged, hugged and taken to the dance floor.
                            This talk is structured with verbal and nonverbal communication between teachers and the public.
