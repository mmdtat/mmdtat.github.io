                    Dear friends, dear artists, and free-spirit people. <br><br>
                    Despite the reality where the pandemic lasts almost 2 years and dance art barely survives with half-closed theatres and dance studios, we keep looking for the place we all can gather and dance truly free and wild. <br><br>
                    The body suffers a lot without dance and movement research and it is needless to say, that emotional stability depends on how do we treat our bodies. So...<br><br>
                    We are thrilled to invite you to spend one week together in a fascinating and ancient place of the world - Fethiye/Turkey in ECO-dance-farm.<br><br>
