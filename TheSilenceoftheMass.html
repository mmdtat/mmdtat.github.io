                    "The Silence of the Mass" is a contemporary dance & contact improvisation performance and research project that explores the embodiment of collective silence in the context of growing political polarization and the rise of extremism in all over the world. Drawing inspiration from practices of contact improvisation and ensemble-based movement, the project investigates the physical and emotional landscapes of submission, complicity, and passive resistance. What happens when a society grows quiet in the face of radical ideologies? How do bodies reflect this silence — as surrender, as tension, as fear, or as resilience?</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The performance will unfold as a dynamic tension between the individual and the group, examining power structures, conformity, and the absence of action. Through structured improvisations and collaborative movement scores, the performers will physically question how silence is carried, enforced, or broken. The project is not a narrative but a moving inquiry: into how political realities inscribe themselves in flesh, into how a crowd behaves when it chooses not to speak.

                    <i>"Our aim is to create a performance that does not offer easy answers, but instead invites the audience into a visceral experience of silence — heavy, fragile, loaded with meaning. Movement will be used as a political and poetic language, evoking the discomfort and beauty of what is unsaid."</i>

                    “The Silence of the Mass” is a collectively created work. Each performer is also a co-creator, contributing to the conceptual, choreographic, and compositional process. The project is interested in investigating horizontal structures of artistic collaboration, where hierarchy is replaced with mutual listening, shared authorship, and distributed responsibility.

                    <br><br>

                    This approach reflects the core of the work itself: a search for embodied democratic practices, for physical negotiation without domination, for creative agency within a collective body.

                    The performer - Tamara Maksymenko is rooted in Ukraine. Within the post soviet childhood, studying in Swiss, working in Lebanon and Morrocco and finally settled in Austria she explored the female aspect from different continents and historical events during her life path.

                    There are notable differences between post-Soviet and Western feminism, shaped by historical, cultural, political, and socio-economic factors, even though they share a common goal of achieving gender equality or justice between two genders. Western feminism, with its roots in democratic processes and civil rights movements, emphasizes individual autonomy, workplace equality, and intersectionality. In contrast, post-Soviet feminism, emerging from a collectivist and tumultuous post-communist landscape, focuses on reconceptualizing gender roles, addressing economic challenges, and overcoming cultural resistance. Post-Soviet societies often have more traditional views on gender roles, with a strong emphasis on motherhood and family.
                    Understanding these differences is crucial for appreciating the diverse manifestations of feminism and the unique challenges faced by women in different regions.
