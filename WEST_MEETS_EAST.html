                    The body suffers a lot without dance and movement research and it is needless to say, that emotional stability depends on how do we treat our bodies. So...<br><br>

                Description of the course:<br>
                We will look at the basic principles of contact improvisation from a different perspective. It is the free use and understanding of the basic principles of movement and interaction that creates the most unusual and beautiful forms of improvisation. Playing with gravity, with the physical possibilities of our bodies and interaction with space will help us to turn every moment of time into an unforgettable and unique dance. We will try to coordinate and activate the entire body system, which will help us instantly respond to any changes in the space inside and outside.  We will learn to feel and respond to the smallest changes as well as to look for our own dance, interest and pleasure.

                Sometimes it's not easy for us to start jams and we often feel uncomfortable dancing solo. I invite you to find your inner peace and self-confidence. We will focus on some solo-improv patterns, release techniques and learn to listen to the body responses and to wake up slowly.<br><br>

                Turkey offers a mind-blowing food culture. Lots of sunny days and the fertile land grows tasty fruits and vegetables. The place where we are going to stay is actually a bio farm itself. We have an option to eat vegetarian, or if you are a carnivore - it's an extra 1,50 euros per meal. In the registration form you have to tag an option: <br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        vegetarian
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        carnivore
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The organizers of the event will carefully note all your preferences. So, if you have anything to emphasize, like allergies, please make a note in the registration form in the field "Message".
