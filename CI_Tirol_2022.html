                    We are thrilled to announce our fourth annual "Solo & CI Tirol Festival" which will traditionally take place in Austria. We believe that our mission is to maintain and strengthen the physical and mental health of our community that becomes vital as never before.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The "Solo & CI Festival" is a safe space for you, your friends and your family, where you will have a chance to get acquainted with contact improvisation, contemporary dance and take part in daily jams. Being surrounded with spectacular Tyrolean landscapes, its impressive mountain ridges, virgin forests, and pure untouchable nature you will get a perfect chance to recharge your batteries and find new meanings and directions.

                    <h1>The Venue</h1> <br>
                <p>
                    We have an amazing NEW place to stay. In the youth center of the small settlement above Innsbruck, Mutters, a cosy, bright, warm dance hall awaits us. There are affordable prices for accommodation and food with a stunning view to Nordkette Mountain ridge.. The space can accommodate 34 guests, which is why there are only 6 rooms with double beds. The other 3 rooms are shared, with 4 to 6 people per room.  <br><br>

                    <h1>Description of the class  "Awareness of listening and perceptions under the Laws of Gravity": </h1><br>
                <p>
                    In this workshop we develop a range of awareness of one's own body and the connection to the partner's body and movement. <br>
                    The focus moves between physical and perceptual skills to open up awareness in order to achieve deeper understanding of active listening, receiving and connectivity.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We will explore and practice supporting/dispersing weight and negotiating gravity. We cultivate skills that support contact improvisation research.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We dive deeper into researching our boundaries and observe differences within shifting proximity and our responsive articulation within me, you and between us.
